# Friend finder

Friend finder is a simple web app to showcase using ExpressJS to create the middleware needed to handle routing in a web 
application. The application will allow the user to fill a simple survey and based on the answers provided, match him/her
with one of the previous survey responders, by computing how close their "scores" are.


### Technologies Used

FriendFinder is built using node.js, darkly bootstrap, and express.js.
