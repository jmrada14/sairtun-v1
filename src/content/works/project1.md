# Noms

### Overview

For this project my team and I decided to build a recipe finder using edamame's API, Youtube API, and a simple design bootstrap made.

### Technologies used: 

The app is built using JavaScript, Jquery, Bootstrap, Youtube and Edamame API.

#### Final result:

I'll show here the original Noms Vs. the new and improved one, 
since a part of the group was not happy with the final result, we applied our philosophy "good enough is never good enough"

[here]() is the improved version.

![And]() this is how the original one looks like.
