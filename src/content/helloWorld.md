##About me
I'm a Software Developer and economist from Venezuela based in NYC. I started my journey with computers at a young age, pretty much interested in information security and automation.
I'm very passionate about software and the way it can help society, reason why I am a big fan of open source projects. I love free as a beer, if you know what I mean...    
Currently I build most of my programs using Node, Ruby, and R for Data Analysis/Manipulation, but also several libraries and frameworks as I listed on my about page.



#####Some extra info:
- I played soccer for about 13 years. Now I'm a Chess player [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/kkaosan)
- I have lived in Venezuela, Argentina, And USA.
- I love my OS, totally recommended [Parrot OS](https://parrotlinux.org/)
- Currently I spent most of my time training my skills as a Programmer.
