##About me
I'm a Software Developer and economist from Venezuela based in NYC. I started my journey with computers at a young age, 
pretty much interested in information security and automation.
I'm very passionate about software and the way it can help society.     
Currently I build most of my programs using Node, Ruby, and R for Data Analysis/Manipulation, but also several libraries
and frameworks as listed on my [about page](/)
