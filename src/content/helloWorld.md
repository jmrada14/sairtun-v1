##About me
I'm a Software Developer and economist from Venezuela based in NYC. I started my journey with computers at a young age,
writing my first Hello World in Python when I was 16, since that very same moment I fell in love with programming,
pretty much interested in information security and automation. Due to my economics background my second programming 
language was R, I was obsessed with Data science and machine learning, I knew it was not the right place to start, and 
after about two years trying to find the right path and studying the very basics of programming I started studying
 web development in the UCF coding bootcamp.  
 
 Currently I build most of my programs using Node, Ruby, and R for Data Analysis/Manipulation, but also several libraries
 and frameworks as listed on my [about page](/).
     
I'm very passionate about software and the way it can help society, I think it is a great tool that can only by stopped 
by imagination.
